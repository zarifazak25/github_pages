# Building Your First GitHub Pages Website

A step-by-step guide to creating and publishing your personal website using GitHub Pages.

---

## Overview

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service that allows you to publish websites directly from your GitHub repository. This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating your first website using pre-built templates.

**Time to complete:** 15-20 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** A Google account or email address  
**Cost:** Free

---

## Step 1: Create Your GitHub Account

1. Navigate to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Sign up using one of these methods:
   - **Google Account:** Click "Sign up with Google" for quick registration
   - **Email Address:** Enter your email and create a password

> **Note:** If you already have a GitHub account, simply log in and proceed to Step 2.

## Step 2: Choose a Template

Selecting the right template is an important decision, as changing templates later requires starting over from Step 1.

1. Visit the [Template Gallery](https://zarifazak25.github.io/pages_template_gallery/)
2. Browse through the available layouts
3. Consider these factors when choosing:
   - Visual style and color scheme
   - Layout structure (single page vs. multi-page)
   - Features included (portfolio, blog, contact form, etc.)
4. Take your time to find a template you'll be happy with long-term

> **Important:** Choose carefully! Switching templates later means recreating your repository from scratch.

## Step 3: Access the Template Repository

Once you've selected your preferred template:

1. Click the **black "GitHub Repo" button** on your chosen template card
2. You'll be redirected to the template's GitHub repository
3. This repository contains all the code needed for your website

---

## Step 4: Create Your Repository

Now you'll create your own copy of the template:

1. Click the **green "Use this template" button** at the top of the repository
2. Select **"Create a new repository"** from the dropdown menu
3. Configure your repository:
   - **Repository name:** Enter your desired website name
     - Example: `my-portfolio` or `john-doe-website`
   - **Description:** Add a brief description of yourself or your website
     - This helps with SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Google discoverability
     - Example: "Personal portfolio showcasing my web development projects"
   - **Visibility:** Keep it set to **Public**
     - ⚠️ Private repositories won't create a publicly accessible website
4. Click **"Create repository"**

> **SEO Tip:** A good description with relevant keywords helps people find your website through Google search.

## Step 5: Understand Your Repository Structure

After creating your repository, you'll see the repository homepage:

### Key Elements

- **`<> Code` tab:** This is your repository homepage where you'll see all files
- **File structure:** You'll notice various files and folders

### Essential Website Files

Every website needs at minimum:

- **HTML files** (`.html`): Structure and content of your web pages
  - Example: `index.html` (your homepage)
- **CSS files** (`.css`): Styling, colors, and layout
  - Example: `style.css` or `main.css`

> **Note:** Advanced websites may include JavaScript files (`.js`), images, and other resources, but HTML and CSS are the foundation.

## Step 6: Configure GitHub Pages Settings

Now let's make your website live on the internet:

1. Navigate to **Settings** (top navigation bar of your repository)
2. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click **"Pages"**
3. Under **"Source"**, configure these settings:
   - **Branch:** Select `main` (or `master` if that's your default branch)
   - **Folder:** Select `/ (root)` or `/docs` depending on your template structure
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub to build and deploy your site

### Finding Your Website URL

After deployment, you'll see a message like:

```
Your site is live at https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/
```

Click this link to view your published website!

## Next Steps

Congratulations! Your website is now live. Here are some suggested next steps:

- **Customize content:** Edit the HTML files to add your personal information
- **Modify styling:** Adjust colors and fonts in the CSS files
- **Add images:** Upload photos to personalize your site
- **Custom domain:** (Optional) Connect a custom domain name to your GitHub Pages site

---

## Troubleshooting

### Website not showing up?
- Verify your repository is set to **Public**
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings → Pages
- Wait a few minutes after making changes (deployments aren't instant)

### Changes not appearing?
- Make sure you've committed and pushed your changes
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- GitHub Pages updates can take 1-2 minutes to reflect
